# Automated Risk-Scoring System for Financial Institutions

The practical part of the automated transaction risk assessment system was developed in the masterâ€™s thesis. Includes scenario-based synthetic data creation, data-quality checks, class-imbalance handling, ML model selection, training/retraining.

This repository contains the source code and experimental artefacts for the master's thesis **"Automated Risk-Scoring System for Financial Institutions"**.  
The system implements an end-to-end workflow for suspicious / high-risk transaction detection, starting from scenario-driven synthetic data creation and finishing with model explainability.

## 1. Overview

The pipeline follows these main stages (see thesis diagram):

1. Choosing a data synthesis method  
2. Building a scenario catalogue (FI guidelines, EU directives)  
3. Synthetic transaction generation  
4. Data-quality check
5. Class-imbalance handling (SMOTE / ADASYN / ROSE)  
6. Model selection (AutoML and expert shortlisting)  
7. Training / retraining mode and threshold update  
8. Adaptivity check  
9. (Planning) Explainability (XAI)

This repository provides code, sample configs and notebooks for each stage.
