**Meeting Minutes**

* **Natalja Krjuckova** - Master’s thesis author

### 1. Purpose of the meeting

The meeting was organised to clarify how to proceed with the master’s thesis *“Developing an automated risk assessment system that uses machine learning”*, especially in conditions where there is not enough real transaction data from Latvian banks.

### 2. Discussion points

#### 2.1 Data availability and preparation

* The author reported problems with **limited amount of real data** for model training.
* **J. Kijonoka** noted that in such a situation it is reasonable to **introduce synthetic data generation** as an explicit stage of the system.
* It was also discussed that **open datasets do not reflect Latvian / AML-specific scenarios**, so they can be used only for method testing, not as final dataset.

#### 2.2 Scenarios and classification

* The author and supervisor discussed **how many scenarios and risk classes** should be supported in the first version.
* It was agreed that small scenarios can be **grouped into larger categories** to reduce model complexity.
* **J. Kijonoka** stressed that **for every scenario/group a data-preparation algorithm must be described** (features, rules, labels).

#### 2.3 Methods and models

* Possible ML methods were mentioned: **tree-based models** and **neural networks**.
* The main difficulty: **many classes + little data + limited computation** → models may not converge or will overfit.
* Therefore, the quality of data and class balance were considered more critical than choosing the most advanced model.

#### 2.4 Agreed approach / plan

* Use **open data** only to test the pipeline structure.
* **Design scenario-based synthetic transactions** to imitate Latvian cases.
* Build a **general methodology** that later can be applied to real data when/if it becomes available.
* Focus first on **data preparation, scenario catalogue and reusability**, then on model optimisation.

#### 2.5 Organisational point

* **J. Kijonoka** agreed to review intermediate materials (scenario list, data-prep description).
* A follow-up meeting will be organised after the author prepares the first version of the scenario catalogue.

### 3. Decisions

1. Main focus for the next stage: **data preparation + synthetic data generation + scenario grouping**.
2. Modelling will continue, but **based on the prepared data**, not the raw open data.
3. The author will prepare draft documents and send them to the supervisor.

---

### 4. Next steps

* **Author:**

  * prepare draft **scenario catalogue**;
  * describe **synthetic data creation step**;
  * outline **data-quality checks**.
* **Supervisor (J. Kijonoka):** review drafts and provide comments.
* Schedule the **next meeting**.
